# SchoolLibraryParser
Tool for parsing school library list dumps. This takes in a file (dumped from school library websites), parses it, and stores the data in a CSV format for easy manipulation and analysis.

There are two versions to this: A CLI version and a GUI (tkinter) version.

## CLI Version

- filepath -> The absolute path to the file that needs to be parsed
- savepath -> The absolute path (including the name of the file) to the file to create/save the results to
