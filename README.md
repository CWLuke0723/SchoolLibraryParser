It then parses it, and stores the data in a CSV format for easy manipulation and analysis.

There are two versions to this: A CLI version and a GUI (tkinter) version.

## CLI Version
This can be run on any PC running Python version `3.7` or higher. Download the code, then open a command line and run the following:
- Navigate to the folder containing the code: `cd [path to SchoolLibraryParser folder]` 
- Type the following command to run the parser:
```python
python schoolLibraryParserCLI.py [-h] schoolName filepath savepath
```
__Inputs__
- schoolName -> Any text, will be added to every line indicating what school the book is in
- filepath -> The absolute path to the file that needs to be parsed
- savepath -> The absolute path (including the name of the file) to the file to create/save the results to

## GUI Version
Download the executable in release [TO BE ADDED]

The GUI version is meant to be an easy option for those that do not have Python setup on their laptops. It is deployed as an executable, and can be run on any mainline OS.
